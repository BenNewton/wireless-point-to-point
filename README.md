This is an ns-3 model that can simulate "perfect" directional links which act 
like point to point links, but are wireless, so that multiple devices are 
attached to a single channel, and connections between devices are explicitly 
specified.  

Based off of ns-3.26 

To use, create a new module in ns-3 called wireless-point-to-point and then 
copy the contents into that new model directory.
