Wireless Point to Point
----------------------------

The Wireless Point to Point model is very similar to the point to point model, 
providing a channel and net device implementation, however the wireless point
to point model can be used to simulate "perfect" directional links which 
essentially form wireless point to point connections.  Many net devices may 
be associated with a channel, but two devices may only communicate when
explicitly "connected" with one another (simulating the state where they are 
pointed and synced).
